- change starting position of planes 
	- check that that part of code actually works

- sometimes planes get in barrel roll loops and never get out 
	- haven't seen this in a while

- droppers + landing doesnt work 
	- DONE. Alex turning off quirks as soon as plane gets in go-home-mode. 

- add twerking quirk!!
	- not for now. let's keep it minimal. can we get away with just 2 quirks? 


- planes shouldnt divebomb to land. perhaps disallow going-to-base when too close to base. 
	- not necessary. 


- find creative commons music for game. 
	- get music here: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?feels%5B%5D=Calming&feels%5B%5D=Mysterious&feels%5B%5D=Mystical&feels%5B%5D=Relaxed&feels%5B%5D=Uplifting 
	- credit musician

- add score + check for whether you made it there before the plane
	- added. fix font size + position
