- sometimes planes get in barrel roll loops and never get out 

- droppers + landing doesnt work -- DONE. Alex turning off quirks as soon as plane gets in go-home-mode. 

- add twerking quirk!!

- planes shouldnt divebomb to land. perhaps disallow going-to-base when too close to base. 

- find creative commons music for game. OR ASK SUFJAN???
